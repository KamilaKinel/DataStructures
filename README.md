# DataStructures
A repository of concise code snippets exemplifying the implementation 
 and application of various data structures. This repository serves as a resource for myself and other developers
wanting to learn more about essential data structures commonly used in software development.

Key Features:

Comprehensive Coverage: Explore a wide range of data structures, including arrays, linked lists, 
                        stacks, queues, trees (binary trees, AVL trees, B-trees), graphs, hash tables, and more. 
                         Each data structure is organized into separate sections for easy access.

Clarity and Brevity: The code snippets are presented in a clear and succinct format, ensuring easy comprehension.
                      They serve as practical references for implementing data structures in real-world scenarios.

Usage Insights: Each code snippet includes comments and documentation explaining the data structure's purpose, 
                characteristics, and common usage scenarios. Gain insight into both implementation and practical applications.
